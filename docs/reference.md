## Invocation

```
mage-mediagc [command] [flags]
```

With no command, the help text is printed. Running from a Magento installation
root requires no configuration at all: the database credentials, media path and
table prefix are read from `app/etc/env.php`.

Mutating commands (`cache clean`, `quarantine`, `restore`, `purge`, `db-clean`)
perform a **dry run** unless `--apply` is given. There is no `--dry-run` flag,
because the dry run is the default.

## Global flags

Every command accepts these.

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--config <path>` | `./mage-mediagc.yaml` | Path to the YAML config file. A missing file at the default path is not an error. |
| `--magento-root <path>` | discovered / from `env.php` | Magento installation root, i.e. the directory containing `app/etc/env.php`. |
| `--media-path <path>` | `<root>/pub/media/catalog/product` | Directory holding original catalog images. |
| `--db-host <host>` | from `env.php` | MySQL host. |
| `--db-port <int>` | from `env.php` | MySQL port. |
| `--db-name <name>` | from `env.php` | Database name. |
| `--db-user <user>` | from `env.php` | Database user. |
| `--db-password <pass>` | from `env.php` | Database password. Prefer the environment variable: a password on the command line is visible in `ps`. |
| `--db-socket <path>` | — | Unix socket path. Overrides host and port. |
| `--workers <int>` | one per CPU, capped at 16 | Parallel workers for scanning and file moves. `0` means auto. |
| `-f`, `--format <table\|json\|markdown>` | `table` | Report encoding. |
| `--language <en\|zh>` | `en` | Report language. Affects `scan`, `verify` and `config show` output only. |
| `--no-content-refs` | off | Skip parsing product descriptions and CMS content for image references. Faster, and **riskier**: images referenced only from rich text will be reported as orphans. |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | `0` | Repeatable. Adds the per-source reference breakdown and per-table database detail. |
| `-q`, `--quiet` | off | Suppress progress output on stderr. Report output is unaffected. |
| `-h`, `--help` | — | Help for the command. |

### Discovery

If `--magento-root` and `--media-path` are both absent, the working directory and
its ancestors are searched for `app/etc/env.php`. If only `--media-path` is
given, the same search starts from `<media-path>/../../..`.

---

## Commands

### `scan`

Read-only. Indexes the media tree, collects references, and reports the
difference. Runs safely on production at any time.

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--db-orphans` | `true` | Include database orphan statistics. Use `--db-orphans=false` to skip the (potentially slow) database sweep. |
| `-o`, `--output <path>` | stdout | Write the report to a file. When writing to a file, ANSI color is disabled automatically. |
| `--top-dirs <int>` | `10` | How many directory buckets to list. Markdown defaults to 20. |

```sh
mage-mediagc scan
mage-mediagc scan --format json --output report.json
mage-mediagc scan --format markdown -vv --output media-report.md
mage-mediagc scan --db-orphans=false --workers 8
```

To skip staging directories left behind by importers, set `scan.excludeGlobs` in
the config file — it has no command-line flag, because it is a property of the
installation rather than of a single run.

Reports, in this order: files on disk, derived thumbnail cache, reference paths
in the database, live files, orphaned files, reclaimable space, the per-source
reference breakdown (verbose), orphan hotspots by directory, database orphan
statistics, and any warnings.

### `list`

Prints bare paths, one per line, with nothing else — suitable for
`rsync --files-from`.

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-k`, `--kind <orphan\|live\|missing>` | `orphan` | Which set to print. |
| `-o`, `--output <path>` | stdout | Write to a file instead of stdout. |
| `--limit <int>` | `0` (all) | Maximum number of paths to print. |

```sh
# Back up every orphan without moving anything
mage-mediagc list --kind orphan --output orphans.txt
rsync -a --files-from=orphans.txt --relative \
  ./pub/media/catalog/product/ /backup/orphans/

# The keep-list, for a migration that only needs live images
mage-mediagc list --kind live --output keep.txt
```

### `cache`

Magento stores every resized variant under
`catalog/product/cache/<md5(parameters)>/<first char>/<second char>/<basename>`.
These files are derived data: no database row names them, and Magento
regenerates each on first request. Removing them is the lowest-risk large win
available.

| Subcommand | Flags | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cache stats` | — | Report the file count and size of the derived cache. |
| `cache clean` | `--apply` | Empty the cache tree and recreate it with the same ownership, so the web server can keep writing to it. |

`cache clean` only ever targets the cache directory below the resolved media
path, and recreates it immediately, so there is no `--force` because there is no
path to get wrong by hand.

```sh
mage-mediagc cache stats
mage-mediagc cache clean            # report what would be freed
mage-mediagc cache clean --apply
```

Expect a temporary slowdown on the first requests afterwards. Consider warming
the cache with `php bin/magento catalog:images:resize`.

### `quarantine`

Moves every file that no reference keeps alive into a holding directory,
preserving the relative directory structure. Files are **moved, not copied**.

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--apply` | off | Perform the move. Without it, only a report is produced. |
| `--quarantine-dir <path>` | `<root>/var/mage-mediagc/quarantine` | Holding directory. Must be on the same filesystem as the media tree. |
| `--max-fraction <float>` | `cleanup.maxDeleteFraction` (`0.98`) | Abort when the orphan ratio exceeds this value. Range `(0, 1]`. |
| `--allow-cross-device` | from `cleanup.allowCrossDevice` | Permit a move across filesystems. The move becomes a full copy, which doubles disk usage for the duration and takes far longer. |
| `--force` | off | Ignore the orphan-ratio abort threshold. |

Refuses to run when:

- no file looks orphaned (nothing to do);
- the orphan ratio exceeds `--max-fraction`, unless `--force` is given;
- the quarantine directory is on a different device, unless
  `--allow-cross-device` is given.

```sh
mage-mediagc quarantine                       # measure
mage-mediagc quarantine --apply               # move
mage-mediagc quarantine --apply --quarantine-dir /data/media-quarantine
```

### `restore`

Reads the manifest written by `quarantine` and moves every recorded file back.
This is the exact inverse of `quarantine`, and the reason quarantining is safe.

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--apply` | off | Perform the restore. |
| `--quarantine-dir <path>` | as above | Holding directory to restore from. |
| `--only <p1,p2>` | all entries | Restore only these relative paths. Comma separated, repeatable. |

A file that already exists at the destination is **skipped, not overwritten**: a
newer upload at the same path should win. If any entries cannot be restored, the
manifest is rewritten to contain only those, so a second `restore` retries just
what is left. Once everything is restored the manifest is removed.

```sh
mage-mediagc restore
mage-mediagc restore --apply
mage-mediagc restore --apply --only h/-/a.jpg,s/-/b.jpg
```

### `purge`

Deletes the contents of the holding directory. This is the point of no return:
quarantining only reserves space by moving files out of the media tree; the
bytes are not actually freed until this runs.

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--apply` | off | Perform the deletion. |
| `--quarantine-dir <path>` | as above | Holding directory to delete. |
| `--force` | off | Delete even without a `mage-mediagc` manifest. |

Refuses to delete a directory that holds files but no manifest, which is the
signature of pointing it at the wrong path.

```sh
mage-mediagc purge            # report what would be freed
mage-mediagc purge --apply
```

Purging does **not** remove orphaned database rows. Run `db-clean` for that.

### `db-clean`

Removes the EAV and gallery rows that survive when products are deleted outside
the admin UI — bulk imports, direct `DELETE`, failed migrations, extensions.

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--apply` | off | Perform the deletion. Without it, only counts are printed. |
| `--batch-size <int>` | `cleanup.batchSize` (`1000`) | Rows per `DELETE` statement. |

Scope is strictly limited to rows whose referenced product or gallery entry no
longer exists. Rows are deleted in bounded batches, each inside its own
transaction, on a dedicated connection with foreign key checks disabled and
restored afterwards. Every table is validated to exist before a single `DELETE`
runs.

Because deleting a row can orphan rows elsewhere — a product's last gallery link
orphans the gallery entry, which orphans its per-store values — the ordered
table list is swept repeatedly until a sweep changes nothing (at most 5 passes).

Back up first:

```sh
mysqldump --single-transaction <db> > pre-db-clean.sql
mage-mediagc db-clean
mage-mediagc db-clean --apply
mage-mediagc db-clean --apply --batch-size 5000
```

### `verify`

Re-runs the analysis and prints a checklist. The quickest way to confirm a
cleanup did what you expected and broke nothing.

Healthy state after a full cleanup:

| Measure | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| orphaned files | `0` |
| missing files | unchanged — cleanup never touches referenced files |
| derived cache | small, and growing again as visitors browse |
| database orphans | `0` |

### `config`

| Subcommand | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `config show` | Print the fully resolved configuration. Passwords are redacted. |
| `config template` | Print a commented YAML configuration template. |

`config show` is the fastest way to answer "why is it talking to the wrong
database": it prints the effective value of every setting and where the config
file was loaded from.

### `version`

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--json` | Print version, commit and build date as JSON. |

Version, commit and build date are injected at build time via `-ldflags`, so a
binary from a release or from `make build` reports real values; `go run` reports
`dev`.

---

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Success. A dry run that reports work to do still exits `0`. |
| `1` | Any error: invalid configuration, unreachable database, a safety rail triggered, or a batch of per-file failures. |

Errors are written to stderr prefixed with `error: `. Progress output also goes
to stderr, so stdout carries only the report and can be piped safely.

`SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` cancel the current operation; the process exits non-zero.

---

## Configuration file

YAML. Every key is optional. Later sources override earlier ones.

```yaml
magento:
  root: /data/wwwroot/shop                 # contains app/etc/env.php
  mediaPath: /data/wwwroot/shop/pub/media/catalog/product

database:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 3306
  name: shop_prod
  user: magegc_ro
  password: ""
  socket: ""                               # overrides host/port when set
  charset: utf8mb4

scan:
  workers: 0                               # 0 = one per CPU, capped at 16
  includeContentRefs: true                 # parse product descriptions and CMS content
  includeCache: false                      # count the derived cache as files on disk
  excludeGlobs: []                         # e.g. ["import_*", "*.tmp"]

cleanup:
  quarantineDir: /data/wwwroot/shop/var/mage-mediagc/quarantine
  batchSize: 1000                          # rows per DELETE
  parallel: 0                              # 0 = one per CPU, capped at 16
  allowCrossDevice: false
  maxDeleteFraction: 0.98                  # abort above this orphan ratio, (0, 1]

output:
  format: table                            # table | json | markdown
  language: en                             # en | zh
  verbose: 0
  quiet: false
```

### Precedence

1. built-in defaults
2. the YAML config file (`--config`, or `mage-mediagc.yaml` in the working
   directory)
3. `<magento root>/app/etc/env.php` — **fills gaps only, never overwrites**
4. `MAGEGC_*` environment variables
5. command-line flags

Step 3 is what makes the tool usable against a replica or a socket without
editing anything: `env.php` supplies the database credentials and media path
only where nothing more explicit has been set.

### Validation

The configuration is validated before any work starts, and all problems are
reported at once rather than one per run:

- `magento.root` or `magento.mediaPath` must be set
- `database.name` and `database.user` are required
- `output.format` must be `table`, `json` or `markdown`
- `output.language` must be `en` or `zh`
- `scan.workers`, `cleanup.batchSize` and `cleanup.parallel` must be `>= 1`
- `cleanup.maxDeleteFraction` must be in `(0, 1]`

Write operations additionally require a derivable quarantine directory and a
readable media path.

---

## Environment variables

| Variable | Equivalent to |
| --- | --- |
| `MAGEGC_MAGENTO_ROOT` | `--magento-root` |
| `MAGEGC_MEDIA_PATH` | `--media-path` |
| `MAGEGC_DB_HOST` | `--db-host` |
| `MAGEGC_DB_PORT` | `--db-port` |
| `MAGEGC_DB_NAME` | `--db-name` |
| `MAGEGC_DB_USER` | `--db-user` |
| `MAGEGC_DB_PASSWORD` | `--db-password` |
| `MAGEGC_DB_SOCKET` | `--db-socket` |
| `MAGEGC_WORKERS` | `--workers` |
| `MAGEGC_QUARANTINE_DIR` | `--quarantine-dir` |
| `MAGEGC_FORMAT` | `--format` |
| `MAGEGC_LANGUAGE` | `--language` |

`MAGEGC_DB_PASSWORD` is read even when empty, so setting it to an empty string
explicitly clears a password taken from `env.php`.

Settings with no environment variable (`cleanup.maxDeleteFraction`,
`cleanup.batchSize`, `scan.excludeGlobs`, `scan.includeContentRefs`, …) belong in
the config file.

For the systemd units, these are set in `/etc/mage-mediagc/mage-mediagc.env`,
which uses systemd's `EnvironmentFile` format: plain `KEY=value`, no `export`,
and quotes are taken literally.

### Test hook

`MAGEGC_TEST_DB_HOST` gates the integration test suite. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

---

## Reference sources

A file counts as **live** if any of these holds. Everything else under the scan
root is an orphan.

| Source | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| `catalog_product_entity_media_gallery` | the product gallery, i.e. everything a gallery-only tool would keep |
| `catalog_product_entity_media_gallery_value` | per-store gallery values, including disabled entries |
| `catalog_product_entity_media_gallery_value_to_entity` | the gallery-to-product links |
| `catalog_product_entity_varchar` | the `image`, `small_image`, `thumbnail`, `swatch_image` and `media_gallery` attributes |
| `catalog_category_entity_varchar` | category `image` and `thumbnail` attributes |
| `catalog_product_entity_text` | images embedded in product descriptions |
| `cms_block`, `cms_page` | images embedded in CMS content |
| `placeholder/` (built in) | Magento's placeholder images, protected without a database lookup — see below |

Attribute lookup goes through `eav_entity_type` rather than a hard-coded
`entity_type_id`, because that id differs between installations.

### The placeholder directory

`catalog/product/placeholder/` is protected unconditionally. Magento references
those files only from `core_config_data` (the `catalog/placeholder/*` paths),
which is a **configuration** table rather than a media table, so reference
collection cannot see them. Without the guard, a stock installation would have
its placeholders reported as orphans and moved out of the media tree.

Protection is by exact directory name: `placeholder-cache/` and `placeholders/`
are ordinary directories and are still eligible for cleanup.

Matching is deliberately conservative: a file is live if *any* candidate path
matches, including a case-insensitive match. A false "live" costs disk space; a
false "orphan" loses an image.

Use `--no-content-refs` (or `scan.includeContentRefs: false`) to skip the
text-parsing sources. That is faster, and it is what makes a shop that embeds
images in CMS blocks unsafe to clean.

---

## On-disk artefacts

`mage-mediagc` writes nothing outside two directories, both of which you choose.

### Quarantine directory

Default `<magento root>/var/mage-mediagc/quarantine`. Contains the moved files
at their original relative paths, plus:

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `_mage-mediagc-manifest.jsonl` | One JSON object per line: `{"path":"h/-/a.jpg","size":20480,"modTime":"2026-09-23T02:00:00Z"}`. Appended as files move, so an interrupted run still describes exactly what moved. |
| `_mage-mediagc-meta.json` | The parameters of the run that populated the directory: media root, whether it was a dry run, the configured threshold. Its presence is what `purge` requires before deleting. |

Both files are rewritten or removed by `restore`; the manifest shrinks to just
the entries that could not be restored, and disappears entirely once everything
is back.

To roll back after a complete purge there is no artefact — that is what makes
`purge` permanent. Take a backup first if the shop cannot tolerate the risk.

### Reports

Only where you ask for them, via `scan --output`. Nothing is written to
`var/log` or anywhere else by the binary itself.

---

## Output formats

### `table` (default)

Human-readable summary on stdout, progress on stderr. ANSI color is used only
when stdout is a TTY and the report is not going to a file.

### `json`

The full machine-readable payload: tool version and commit, generation
timestamp, the target (media root, Magento root, database, MySQL version), the
analysis, and the database orphan report. The orphan **file list is deliberately
excluded** — a report of a 448,000-file catalog should not be a 448,000-line
document. Use `list` for paths.

Stable enough to parse; keys are `camelCase`.

### `markdown`

A self-contained document suitable for attaching to a ticket: header,
summary table, per-source reference breakdown, orphan hotspots, database orphans,
warnings, numbered next steps using real commands, and the first 50 missing
files if any. Localized via `--language`.

In all three formats, logs, errors and the JSON payload stay English.

---

## Compatibility notes

- **Magento 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 schemas** are all supported. The tool reads the
  schema it finds rather than assuming one; tables that are absent are reported
  as skipped with a reason instead of aborting the run.
- **Table prefixes** are read from `env.php` (`db.table_prefix`) and applied to
  every query.
- **MySQL 5.7+ and MariaDB 10.2+.** Only `db-clean` needs write access; every
  other command works with a read-only user.
- **No PHP, no `bin/magento`, no Composer.** `app/etc/env.php` is parsed by a
  purpose-built parser, so the tool works on a replica, in a container, or while
  the shop is down.
- **No Magento bootstrap.** The tool never includes Magento code, so it cannot
  be broken by a module conflict or a broken `di:compile`.
