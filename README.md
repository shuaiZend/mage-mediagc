## The problem

Magento 2 has no garbage collector for catalog media.

Delete a product through the admin UI and the catalog cleans up after itself.
Delete products the way real shops actually delete them — a bulk import, a
direct `DELETE`, a failed migration, an extension — and nothing cascades:

- rows survive in `catalog_product_entity_media_gallery`,
  `..._media_gallery_value_to_entity`, `..._media_gallery_value` and the five
  product EAV tables (`_varchar`, `_int`, `_text`, `_decimal`, `_datetime`)
- the image files those rows referenced stay on disk forever
- and so does the derived thumbnail cache, one directory per size variant per
  image

Nothing in `bin/magento` removes any of it. There is no official image GC
command. The growth is silent and permanent.

This is not a theoretical concern. On one long-running production catalog:

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `pub/media/catalog/product` | **160 GB**, 1,490,995 files |
| Original images still referenced | **59,281** files, 14.5 GB |
| Orphaned originals | **448,403** files, **102.46 GB — 88.3%** |
| Derived thumbnail cache | 983,330 files, 42 GB |
| Products in the database | 7,132 |
| Residue EAV entity ids | 69,366 |
| Orphaned database rows | ~2.33 million |

Accretion was ongoing, not historical: roughly 30,000–50,000 new orphan files
per year, every year since 2020.

`mage-mediagc` finds that garbage and removes it — without ever deleting an
original image in a step you cannot undo.

## Why not one of the existing modules

There are several Magento modules that do part of this. Two problems make them
unsafe to point at a live shop.

**They compare against the gallery only.** An image is kept alive by more than
`catalog_product_entity_media_gallery`:

| Reference source | Gallery-only tools | mage-mediagc |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| `catalog_product_entity_media_gallery` | yes | yes |
| `image` / `small_image` / `thumbnail` / `swatch_image` attributes | no | yes |
| category `image` / `thumbnail` attributes | no | yes |
| images embedded in product descriptions | no | yes |
| images embedded in CMS pages and blocks | no | yes |
| Magento's placeholder images | no | yes |

A category banner or a product photo inside a CMS block is referenced by
nothing in the gallery. A gallery-only tool reports it as an orphan and
deletes it. That is data loss on a live shop.

Placeholders are a subtler case: they are referenced only from
`core_config_data`, which is a configuration table rather than a media table, so
even a tool that reads every media table will not see them. `mage-mediagc`
protects `catalog/product/placeholder/` outright.

**They delete in place.** There is no quarantine, no manifest, no rollback.

## What it does

| Stage | Command | Risk | Reversible |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Report | `scan` | none, read-only | n/a |
| Clear thumbnails | `cache clean --apply` | none, Magento regenerates them | n/a |
| Isolate orphans | `quarantine --apply` | files moved, originals intact | `restore --apply` |
| Free the space | `purge --apply` | **permanent** | no |
| Remove stale rows | `db-clean --apply` | **permanent** | restore from backup |

The design rule is simple: **nothing deletes an original image.** Removing an
orphan means *moving* it into a holding directory on the same filesystem,
where `os.Rename` is an inode operation — microseconds per file, no extra disk
space, no copy. Isolating 448,403 files takes seconds. If the shop looks wrong
afterwards, `restore` puts every file back exactly where it came from.

## Install

### Release binary

```sh
VERSION=$(curl -sSL https://api.github.com/repos/shuaiZend/mage-mediagc/releases/latest \
  | grep -o '"tag_name": *"v[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f4)

curl -sSLO "https://github.com/shuaiZend/mage-mediagc/releases/download/${VERSION}/mage-mediagc_${VERSION#v}_linux_amd64.tar.gz"
tar xzf "mage-mediagc_${VERSION#v}_linux_amd64.tar.gz"
sudo install -m 0755 mage-mediagc /usr/local/bin/
mage-mediagc version
```

Or pick the archive you want from the
[releases page](https://github.com/shuaiZend/mage-mediagc/releases) —
Linux, macOS and Windows, `amd64` and `arm64`, all statically linked with
`CGO_ENABLED=0`. No runtime, no `composer require`, nothing installed into the
shop.

### Packages

`.deb`, `.rpm` and `.apk` packages are attached to each release. They install
the binary to `/usr/local/bin`, a commented config to `/etc/mage-mediagc/`,
and the optional systemd units, which are left **disabled** on purpose:

```sh
sudo apt install ./mage-mediagc_*_linux_amd64.deb
sudo $EDITOR /etc/mage-mediagc/mage-mediagc.env     # set MAGEGC_MAGENTO_ROOT
mage-mediagc scan --config /etc/mage-mediagc/mage-mediagc.yaml
```

### Docker

```sh
docker run --rm \
  --network host \
  -v /data/wwwroot/shop:/magento \
  ghcr.io/shuaiZend/mage-mediagc scan --magento-root /magento
```

`--network host` is needed when MySQL listens on the host rather than in a
container. The image runs as root by default because its job is renaming files
owned by the web server; pass `--user` to run as the shop's own uid instead.

### From source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/shuaiZend/mage-mediagc
cd mage-mediagc
make build          # honors GOHOSTOS/GOHOSTARCH
sudo ./deploy/install.sh --binary ./mage-mediagc
```

## Quick start

Run it from the Magento root. There is nothing to configure — the database
credentials, the media path and the table prefix all come from
`app/etc/env.php`, which is parsed directly, with no PHP runtime required.

```sh
cd /data/wwwroot/shop

# 1. Read-only. Safe on production, safe at any time.
mage-mediagc scan

# 2. Isolate what step 1 reported. Nothing is deleted.
mage-mediagc quarantine --apply

# 3. Verify the shop. Then either free the space...
mage-mediagc purge --apply

# ...or roll the whole thing back.
mage-mediagc restore --apply
```

A scan on the catalog described above reports:

```

Output from a real run against the catalog described above. `-v` adds the
reference-source breakdown shown here; `--top-dirs` controls how many orphan
hotspots are listed.

`--format json` and `--format markdown` produce machine-readable and
ticket-ready versions of the same report. The Markdown version is a
self-contained document with numbered next steps.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `scan` | Index the media tree, collect references, report the difference |
| `list --kind orphan\|live\|missing` | Print individual paths |
| `cache stats` / `cache clean --apply` | Measure or clear the thumbnail cache |
| `quarantine --apply` | Move orphans into the holding directory |
| `restore --apply` | Put quarantined files back |
| `purge --apply` | Delete the holding directory (refuses one it did not create) |
| `db-clean --apply` | Delete rows pointing at deleted products |
| `verify` | Re-check a media tree against the database after a change |
| `config show` / `config template` | Print the resolved configuration |
| `version` | Print version, commit and build date |

Every mutating command is a dry run unless `--apply` is given. Full flag
reference: [docs/reference.md](docs/reference.md).

## Configuration

Five sources, later ones winning:

1. built-in defaults
2. `mage-mediagc.yaml` (from `--config`, or auto-discovered in the working
   directory)
3. `<magento root>/app/etc/env.php` — **fills gaps only, never overwrites**
4. `MAGEGC_*` environment variables
5. command-line flags

The gap-filling rule in step 3 is what makes the tool usable against a replica
or a socket without editing anything: whatever you set explicitly is never
replaced.

Start from [examples/mage-mediagc.yaml](examples/mage-mediagc.yaml) (fully
commented) and [examples/mage-mediagc.env](examples/mage-mediagc.env) (for the
systemd units). Details: [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

## Deployment

The binary is static and self-contained, so deployment is a file copy. Two
ways, depending on how much automation you want.

**Manual / ad hoc** — copy the binary and run it. Nothing else is needed.

**Scheduled, safe-only** — the packages ship two systemd timers:

| Timer | Schedule | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mage-mediagc-scan.timer` | weekly, jittered | writes a read-only markdown report to `/var/log/mage-mediagc/scan-latest.md` |
| `mage-mediagc-cache.timer` | daily, jittered | clears the derived thumbnail cache |

Both are disabled by default and are read-only or regenerable by construction.
Quarantining and database cleanup are **never** scheduled — those stay manual,
because they are the steps a human should look at the numbers before running.

```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now mage-mediagc-scan.timer mage-mediagc-cache.timer
journalctl -u mage-mediagc-scan.service -n 50
```

procedure: [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) and

## Safety model

- **Read before write.** `scan`, `list`, `cache stats`, `config show` and
  `verify` cannot modify anything.
- **Dry run by default.** Every destructive command requires `--apply`.
- **Move, never delete.** Orphans are renamed into a quarantine directory, with
  a JSONL manifest recording every path, so `restore` is exact.
- **Same filesystem enforced.** The run refuses to cross devices, because a
  silent copy would double disk usage and take hours. `--allow-cross-device`
  overrides it.
- **Ratio guard.** `quarantine` aborts when the orphan ratio exceeds
  `cleanup.maxDeleteFraction` (default 0.98). A ratio that extreme nearly
  always means reference collection failed, not that the shop really is that
  full of garbage.
- **Conservative matching.** A file counts as live if *any* candidate path
  matches, including a case-insensitive one. A false "live" costs disk space; a
  false "orphan" loses an image.
- **Guard rails on the database.** Every table is validated to exist before a
  single `DELETE` runs, rows are removed in bounded batches inside individual
  transactions, and foreign key checks are disabled only for the duration on a
  dedicated connection.
- **Purge refuses to improvise.** `purge` will not delete a directory that has
  no manifest, unless you pass `--force`.

## Delivery standards

This project is built to the conventions expected of a production open-source
tool, and every one of these is enforced in CI:

| Gate | How |
| --- | --- |
| Formatting | `gofmt -s -l` must be empty |
| Static analysis | `go vet` + `golangci-lint` (24 linters, zero findings) |
| Module hygiene | `go mod tidy` must be a no-op |
| Unit tests | `go test -race` on Linux and macOS |
| Go compatibility | 1.21, 1.22, 1.23, 1.24 |
| Integration tests | full pipeline against real MySQL 5.7 **and** 8.0 |
| Cross-compilation | linux/darwin/windows × amd64/arm64 |
| Release artefacts | goreleaser: archives, deb/rpm/apk, checksums, changelog |
| Containers | multi-arch `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64` image on GHCR |
| Supply chain | CodeQL (security-and-quality), Dependabot, SHA-256 checksums |

The integration suite is the part that matters most: it builds a miniature but
faithful Magento catalog schema, fills it with the exact debris this tool
exists to remove, then runs scan → analyze → dry run → clean → quarantine →
restore → purge and asserts the outcome, including the cascade where removing
a product's last gallery link orphans the gallery entry and then its per-store
values.

## Comparison

| | mage-mediagc | Magento modules doing this |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Language | Go, single static binary | PHP, installed into the shop |
| Install | copy a file | `composer require` + `setup:upgrade` |
| Works while the shop is down | yes | no (needs Magento bootstrap) |
| Reference sources | 5, including CMS and descriptions | gallery only |
| Rollback | quarantine + manifest + `restore` | none |
| Runs at scale | parallel, sharded, binary-search lookups | single process, in-process |
| Machine-readable output | JSON and Markdown | no |
| Deletes database rows | opt-in, batched, validated | varies |

## Requirements

- A Magento 2 installation (tested against 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 schemas) or any
  `magento_*`-shaped database
- MySQL 5.7+ or MariaDB 10.2+ reachable with read/write access for
  `db-clean`; read-only is enough for everything else
- No PHP on the host, no `bin/magento`, no Composer
